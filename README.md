# mini-jukebox

It's not the most elegant jukebox, but it's a jukebox. And I can use it to play an audio file in my terminal (only mp3 works for now).

It also comes with file metadata displayed with color, and a progress bar.

To run exec `cargo run <path to .mp3>`.

Will revisit the project when I'm a litte more familiar with Rust.
